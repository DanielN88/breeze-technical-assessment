# Intro
This cypress testing environment was created to demonstrate the contributors cypress abilities to Breeze. Please browse through the intro testing specs following the flight booking user flows.

# Technologies Used
- Cypress

## Set Up with Cypress

 1. Start by going [here](https://github.com/DanielN88/breeze-technical-assessment). From here you will want to click on the green rectangular button titled 'Code'. This should open a drop down menu where you should see a link. Please copy that link and clone down the repo onto your local machine. 
 2. Once you have cloned the repo, navigater into the directory and install cypress if you do not already have it. Run `npm i -D cypress` and then add the following to your package.json 
 3. Once everything has been installed you may start cypress with `npm run cypress`
 4. Please run the tests with the browser google chrome only as I disabled some chrome web security features to work around a CORS issue. 

 ## Features
 
 1. Testing the elements and navigation of the homepage flight selection.

 ## Future Goals with More Time

 1. Accomplish more sad path testing with a greater focus on user error handling.
 2. Work more in depth with stubbing and intercepting calls to check our application is working with a variety of mock data. Also test to ensure our application still runs when different status code errors are being thrown. I wanted to incorperate intercepting, but could not find a way without access to the json contract showing what data structure was required. 
 3. If desired implement unit testing to ensure correct funtional outputs.
